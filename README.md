# Predicting Wine Quality
It is a machine learning project. The dataset contains different type of things that effects the quality such as citric acid, pH, density etc. The goal is find the optimum machine learning method. In order to make a good prediction, handling data is very important, with this project you will see the different way of handling data. You can read the pdf file or you can download the ipynb and the dataset to create the same project and maybe make it better.
